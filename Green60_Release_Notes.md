📌 **Before You Begin: Setup Requirements**

During the initial setup of the app, you will need to provide the following three pieces of information:

1. **Device Name** — This is typically the name of the site or room number (e.g., "Room101", "FrontDesk").  
   👉 Please **enter the device name without spaces** (e.g., use "Room101" instead of "Room 101").
2. **Green60 Admin Username**
3. **Green60 Admin Password**

🔁 If you are reinstalling the app, please make sure to use the **same device name** as before  
to maintain continuity and avoid duplicate entries.

Make sure to have these credentials ready before launching the app for the first time.
